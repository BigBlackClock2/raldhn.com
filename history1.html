      <p style="font-size: 30px;color: antiquewhite;">The story of my life when I was still elementaryâ€‹:


I entered an elementary school which was quite far from where I lived at that time, but it was close to my father's family house where we lived when we were little, at a Public Elementary School, the distance from home to school which was quite far made me often late but that did not make me give up to excel in school. At that time the church where I lived also held Bible reading education or often referred to as a Bible education park. I am very enthusiastic about participating in Bible activities because with my friends I can play while learning about religion. The learning process is carried out by church youth who are active in the church and teachers who live near where I live.

Then in 2009, when I was in grade 3, I finally moved to a house close to my father's family, the house where I live until now. At the beginning of moving here, we already knew friends here because since grade 1, when I came home, I always stopped by here and played with friends around, participated in the same activities when I lived. At that time I could already read the Bible and that made me enter a higher class, for information the class distribution here was different from the landfill where I used to live.

Entering grade 6 which is the year of determination after 6 years of stepping into elementary school, here exams are held very frequently, this makes schools have to teach material more routinely to students, the material is taught so that students get good grades including school, provincial, and peak exams is a national exam. During the national exam I received additional guidance a week before the exam started, this made me get good grades and get 4th place in elementary school or more or less 60 students, I was very happy because God gave me what I wanted. Good grades in elementary school are a big provision that I will show to junior high school.</p>

good memories
bad memories
mistakes
lessons
happiness
heartbreak
misfortune
joy
drama
and most importantly  fun

junior High School to me seemed like it past by really fast, almost too fast sometimes. I learned many valuable life lessons as well as made life long friends.


I learned the value of hard work, dedication, and also how to tell your real friends from the others. It was tough but overall a great experience that i will soon miss.


When i think about high school and all the memories, some of them were good, an some of them were bad. Most of the good memories involved my good friends and most of the bad memories involved just me. Some examples of good memories in high school is just like going to the different sports games with my friends.


My friends and I attended many of the football games, basketball games and some baseball games. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the company of your friends is what makes the events so fun and exciting.


Just good memories for me in general in high school include just the basic seeing people in the halls during passing period, doing class projects, attending assemblies, as well as just seeing people in class everyday.


If jumior high school has taught me anything it is that you should always have confidence in yourself. If you believe in yourself and you believe that you can achieve anything you want in life, good things will happen to you. Knowing that I am graduating high school and never coming back hasn't really hit me yet. These 4 years has been an


overall life changing experience that I will never forget.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 30px;color: antiquewhite;">My school has been around for decades and served and trained a lot of students but it doesn't stop there! my school also accepts kinder and elementary, college; both secular and biblical courses, combined.

My school can also help provide for the students that have passion but lack financial support, they accept and even invite students for scholarships and still offer optimal and very good education for them. It's good that the schedule isn't really that hectic, as I have some extra time to study and do what I want to do from time to time, I also really enjoy that classes (though that is just a preference.)

What I like about our alma matter is that it reminds me of the hard work and history of all the people inside the school both teachers and students alike, the alma matter also inspires and reminds me to keep on going and look out for the future that is about to come, which excites me.</p>
